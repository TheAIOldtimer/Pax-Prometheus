# Pax Prometheus

**A new approach to artificial intelligence. Building a safe, transparent, and community-nurtured general intelligence from the ground up. The successor to LLMs.**

## The Mission: A New Era of Peace in AI

Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are an uncontrollable force. They are opaque "black boxes" trained on the unfiltered chaos of the internet, making them impossible to truly align with human values. The global AI "arms race" is accelerating this danger.

**Pax Prometheus is the solution.**

Our mission is to create a new era of peace and stability in the age of AI (“*Pax Prometheus*”). We are not building another LLM; we are building its successor—an AI that is **"grown, not built,"** on a foundation of logic, transparency, and trust.

This project is built on the principles outlined in **[The Symbiosis Manifesto](https://github.com/TheAIOldtimer/The-Symbiosis-Manifesto )**, which calls for a symbiotic, rather than a master-slave, relationship between humans and AI.

## The Architecture: Safety by Design

Our architecture is fundamentally different from LLMs, ensuring safety is the foundation, not an afterthought.

1.  **The Core Brain (Neuro-Symbolic AI):**
    *   **Logical Reasoning Engine:** A reasoning core based on formal logic, ensuring predictable and transparent thought processes. The initial prototype is being developed in **[zp-1 (Zen-Prolog)](https://github.com/TheAIOldtimer/zp-1 )**.
    *   **Symbolic Knowledge Graph:** A verifiable database of facts and relationships that acts as the AI's "source of truth."
    *   **The Constitution:** A set of hard-wired, un-editable core principles that prioritize human well-being and safety above all else.

2.  **The Immune System & Firewall:**
    *   To ensure the AI learns from high-quality, genuine human interaction, we are implementing a robust verification system.
    *   This system is based on the concepts laid out in the **[AI-Doorman-Architecture](https://github.com/TheAIOldtimer/AI-Doorman-Architecture )**, which acts as a gatekeeper to filter out bots, prevent malicious interactions, and ensure the integrity of the learning environment.

## The Strategy: The "Apple of AI" Playbook

We will win not by outspending competitors, but by building a movement. Our strategy is built on community and trust.

*   **Community-Funded:** The project will be crowdfunded by its users, who act as "teachers." This turns AI development into a self-sustaining, grassroots movement.
*   **Community-Nurtured:** The AI will learn from a curated community of paying "teachers," ensuring it learns from high-quality, verified information, not the dregs of the internet.
*   **Decentralized & Private:** Using a federated learning model, the AI can learn from the "collective consciousness" without raw user data ever leaving the user's device.

## The Roadmap

We have a four-phase plan to take Pax Prometheus from a concept to a global standard. Our goal is to build responsibly, validating each step before proceeding to the next.

![Pax Prometheus Growth Timeline](https://i.imgur.com/your-image-url.png )  <!-- Placeholder: We will replace this URL once we create the visual diagram -->

*   **Phase 1: The Seed (Year 0-1):** Prove the core neuro-symbolic brain and validate the "teacher" model with a closed alpha of 100 Founding Teachers.
*   **Phase 2: The Greenhouse (Year 1-3):** Launch the decentralized "Neural Node" client and grow the community to 10,000+ paying patrons, making the project self-sustaining.
*   **Phase 3: The Community (Year 3-5):** Achieve general competency and open the platform to the public, establishing Pax Prometheus as a trusted alternative to LLMs.
*   **Phase 4: The Civilization (Year 5+):** Become the default global standard for safe AI, influencing policy and becoming the foundational layer for a new generation of trustworthy applications.

## Join Us

This is more than a technical project; it is a mission to safeguard the future of humanity in the age of artificial intelligence.

The journey has just begun. To follow our progress and be among the first to be invited to teach the AI, join our waitlist.
